== PROJECT: EasyTravel

The purpose of this document is to document my contribution I have made to the project.

*_EasyTravel_* Github link: https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-w17-3.github.io/main/

== Overview

EasyTravel is a desktop travel planning application done by me and 4 other software engineering students for students who are planning for an overseas trip.

EasyTravel helps to reduce the amount of stress when planning for a trip by providing 5 main list: activity, transport booking, accommodation booking, packing list and fixed expense.

EasyTravel has a GUI created with JavaFX and user can interact with it through a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented Accommodation Booking Tab and commands

** What it does: The accommodation booking feature allows the user to keep track of all the accommodation bookings made before a trip. User can input details of the accommodation as well as the start and end day of the booking.

** Justification: This feature is useful in allowing users to keep track of the accommodations they have booked.

** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: Find overlaps in accommodation bookings

** What it does: Prevent users from entering multiple accommodation bookings that overlaps one another.

** Justification: To prevent users from booking overlapping accommodations or to prevent them from recording an accommodation that overlaps with other accommodations.

* *Minor enhancement*: Status check for missing accommodation days

** What it does: List down to the user the days that has missing accommodations.

** Justification: To give users an idea of the days that are missing accommodations so they can book it before going on the trip.

=== Accommodation Booking

Accommodation is something you can miss out on planning and this feature is for you to plan for your accommodation and record them down. You can record the following information about your transport bookings:

- Name of the accommodation
- The location or address
- The first day when you check-in
- The last day when you check-out
- Remarks you want to note for an accommodation booking

=== Accommodation Booking feature

**E.T.** allows the user to keep track of their accommodation bookings for his/her trip. The accommodation booking manager is one of the ``ListManager``s (See <<List-Manager>>). On top of the basic operations provided by a `ListManager`, it also prevents the user from having overlapping accommodation bookings.

==== Rationale

The transport booking manager is an important feature to have because any oversea trip of more than one day will require some form of accommodation. Thus, we decided to create an accommodation booking manager as one of the ``ListManager``s.

==== Current Implementation

When a user adds an accommodation booking, the `Logic` Component parses the user input and creates an `AddAccommodationBookingCommand` object (See <<Design-Logic>>). When the `execute()` method of `AddAccommodationBookingCommand` is called, the execution will check if the new accommodation booking overlaps with any other other current bookings.

Using a Java’s <<stream, __stream__>>, the new accommodation booking will be checked against all other bookings in the list to look for any overlaps.
We used an interval overlap detection algorithm to check for overlap between 2 accommodation bookings. If the total duration of the 2 accommodation bookings is within the __acceptable duration__ of the algorithm, then there is no overlap.
__acceptable duration__ = latest end day - earliest start day

The following diagram gives a visual explanation on this interval overlap detection algorithm.

.Visual explanation on the interval overlap detection algorithm
image::developer-guide/accommodation-booking/OverlappingIntervalAlgorithm.png[]

The following steps describe the flow of an overlap check between 2 accommodation bookings:

. The start day and end day of both bookings are retrieved using `getStartDay()` and `getEndDay()` methods of the `AccommodationBooking` object.
. The total duration of both accommodation bookings is calculated.
. The latest end day and earliest start day is obtained.
. The __acceptable duration__ is calculated.
. If the __acceptable duration__ is greater than the total duration of both bookings, there is no overlap. The overlap check will continue for the next accommodation booking until the last.
If there is an overlap, the check will stop and the user will receive a message that informs them that the new accommodation booking will overlap with another booking.

The __Activity Diagram__ below summaries the above steps.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Calculating overlap of the new accommodation booking with the other accommodation bookings in the list

|===
| |Pros |Cons
|**Option 1 (Current)** +
Use an interval overlap detection algorithm.

In the worst case, the checking for overlap against all accommodation booking takes O(n) time where n is the number of accommodation bookings

|Simple and easy to implement.

Only require constant space to calculate overlaps between 2 intervals.

|Requires some calculation.

|**Option 2** +
Use a hashtable to store the days that have been accounted for.

In the worst case, the checking for overlap against all accommodation booking takes O(d) time where d is the number of days.

|Simple and easy to implement.

Checking for any particular day takes constant time.

|Require a large amount of storage space to save the hashtable data.
|===

Reason for choosing option 1:

* Both options are simple and easy to implement. However, option 2 has a larger overhead due to the hashtable it uses. Thus, we decided option 1 is better.
